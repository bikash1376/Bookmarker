# Fixes Applied

1.  **Dependencies**: Reinstalled `next-themes` and shadcn components. Typescript check passed.
2.  **UI**: Refined the `Card` component usage.
3.  **Realtime Debug**: Added logging to the browser console.

**Please Test Again**:
1.  Refresh both tabs.
2.  Open Console (F12).
3.  Add a bookmark.
4.  Check if `Realtime payload:` appears in the console of the *other* tab.

If it works, great! If not, tell me what you see in the console.
