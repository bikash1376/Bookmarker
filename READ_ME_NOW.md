# Mission Accomplished!

The Smart Bookmark App is fully updated with all requested features.

## Vital Step for Realtime
**You MUST run this SQL in your Supabase Dashboard:**
```sql
alter publication supabase_realtime add table bookmarks;
```
Without this, the realtime sync will **NOT** work.

## New Features
- **Realtime Sync**: Bookmarks update instantly across tabs.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle in the header.
- **Improved UI**: Avatars, Footer, Cursor pointers.
- **SEO**: Metadata updated.

Enjoy your app!
